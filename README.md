Sample Holders
--------------

Sample holder designed to be easily manufactured using common tools or 3D printed.

LAB-001-010 - Sample holder for slabs with > 0.8 mm thickness and > 9 mm wide. Can be applied in optical measurments in transmission and reflection.

-----------

to be added:

LAB-001-020 - Sample holder for anisotropic thick samples. Design to allow sample roll adjust, samples front surface reference and reflection measurments in +/-90ยบ.

LAB-001-030 - Sample holder for longitudinal MOKE measurements in a GMW 5403 eletromagnet 76 mm diamter poles. Samples wide from 4 mm up to < 10mm.
